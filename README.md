## picgo-plugin-heic2others

Convert HEIC Photo to other formats (eg. JPEG).

Currently it only convert HEIC to JPEG with `.jpg` extension name, for uploading original photos shot by iOS devices that enable HEIC. More functions will be added if I have time.

### Usage

- Searching `heic2others` and install it in `Plugin Settings` in PicGo GUI.
- Executing the folowing command if using PicGo CLI:

  ```bash
  picgo add heic2others
  ```

### Thanks

- [catdad-experiments/heic-convert: ðŸ¤³ convert heic/heif images to jpeg and png](https://github.com/catdad-experiments/heic-convert), which provides the converting tool.
- [hans362/picgo-plugin-remove-exif: Remove EXIF data before uploading](https://github.com/hans362/picgo-plugin-remove-exif), which provides an easy template of the plugins of [PicGo](https://github.com/PicGo/PicGo-Core).
  - Unfortunately, the plugin is not compatibile with it, and I have no idea of how to fix it due to my lack of JavaScript, so I am looking forward to receiving pull requests of it.
